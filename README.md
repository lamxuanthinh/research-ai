## Creating a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a virtual environment for this project to isolate its dependencies from other Python projects on your system. Here's how you can create a virtual environment:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.

3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "venv":

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

  This will create a new directory named "venv" in your project's root directory.

4. Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:

  - For macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

  - For Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

  Once activated, you will see "(venv)" in your command prompt, indicating that you are now working within the virtual environment.

5. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  This will install all the necessary packages specified in the "requirements.txt" file.

6. You are now ready to run the scripts and explore the machine learning algorithms in this project!

7. When you're done working with the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running the following command:

  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

  This will return you to your system's default Python environment.

Note: It is good practice to include the "venv" directory in your project's `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to version control.
